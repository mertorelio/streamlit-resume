             <pre>\tI'm 4th grade computer engineer student at Ondokuz Mayis University. 
             I am the organizer of GDG Samsun. 
             I was a core member and mentor in the Global AI Hub organization.
             I'm interested in AI.So I'm constantly trying to teach new things in this field.
             I've been using Python for 3 years,
            I'm also work with Tensorflow/Keras. I have some theoretical knowledge in the field
            of ML/DL. I am trying to improve myself by reading documents and reading
            different codes on kaggle. I'm still trying to improve myself in various subjects like data
            analysis, NLP, transformers, GANs. I don't have any professional experience in IT or AI but i
            think i'm good at learning new things. I'm still looking for a job or internship.
